# Some-Utils-Codes-STM32-
Some fragments of code that I take as something usefull and I will try to keep it updated at least for this year.
The main topic of this repository is the STM32 Microcontrollers, especially the STM32-F411 / STM32-F446. I will try to post some codes like: rising edge detection of a button, how to count how much time has been since the first time that a button has been pressed, some pretty basic serial communication and stuff like that, nothing much complicated, just some simple and basic code to refresh my memory when needed.
